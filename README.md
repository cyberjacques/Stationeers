Scripts and a helpful diagram for controlling the Advanced Furnace to automate the creation of alloys. This is based on the impressive work found here:
https://github.com/xennon101/Stationeers/tree/master/Automated%20Advanced%20Furnace
This is a much-simplified version, without any of the pre- or post-processing, no sorting of ores or any of the fancy stuff.  It is also in need of improvement, since the ore must still be fed manually, and it requires a bit of a "cold start" every time the system is run, meaning you must shut the Furnace Control processor off, then pop the chip out and back in, before you select a new alloy on the dial and then turn the Furnace Control on again.  The Selection Control updates the new settings properly without being reset, but additonal logic is needed to make the Furnace Control reset properly. I tried to improve on the up-down adjustment time from Xennon's version for getting the temp and pressure just right, but with limited success. There's a high and a low setting, with the low being used for the superalloys with their tighter tolerances. It helps, but more with fuel consumption than time. Has been successfully tested with all the alloys as of version 0.2.2445.11152.

Note: the fuel input pressure in my test setup was maintained at roughly 3MPa, not sure if that makes a difference with the internal pumps of the furnace.
